                    <p>I am originally from Washington State. I moved to Louisville four years ago from Seattle 
                       with my husband, two kids, one dog, and one cat. We have loved exploring our new city and state but 
                       have especially loved the sunshine! It's life changing after living in the rain for most of my life.
                    </p>
                    <br>
        
                    <p>I've taken the last 12 years away from work to raise a family. Entering the work force agian is both scary and exciting.
                        Before I had kids I worked in the restaurant industry which was fun and tought me a lot about people and life
                        (also food and wine) but I was ready for something different.
                    </p>
                    <br>
        
                    <p>I was drawn to coding for a few reasons. I like that I'm learning a marketable skill. I also like the creative
                        aspect to coding. Being able to design and build websites, something literally everyone uses, is exciting.
                    </p>
